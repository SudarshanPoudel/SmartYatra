## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional, for database persistence)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/smart-yatra.git
   cd smart-yatra/backend
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory.
   - Add necessary keys (e.g., API keys for AI services).

5. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```
   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Additional Notes
- **Database**: Ensure ChromaDB is set up before running the backend. The database directory (`chromadb/`) is ignored in Git.
- **Testing**: Use `test.ipynb` for debugging backend components. This file is also ignored in Git.
